      <term target-id="extinction">Extinction</term> (the complete
      disappearance of a species from Earth) is an important part of
      the evolution of life on Earth. The current diversity of species
      is a product of the processes of extinction and speciation
      throughout the previous 3.8 billion year history of life. Raup
      (<cite target-id="raup"><cite-title>1991</cite-title></cite>) assumed that there might be 40
      million species alive today, but between 5 and 50 billion
      species have lived at some time during the history of the
      Earth. Therefore, Raup estimated that 99.9% of all the life that
      has existed on Earth is now <term target-id="extinct">extinct</term>); a species is assumed to be
      extinct when there is no reasonable doubt that the last
      individual has died (<cite target-id="iucn"><cite-title>IUCN, 2002</cite-title></cite>).
      However, extinction has not occurred at a constant pace through
      the Earthâ€™s history. There have been at least five
      periods when there has been a sudden increase in the rate of
      extinction, such that the rate has at least doubled, and the
      extinctions have included representatives from many different
      taxonomic groups of plants and animals; these events are called
      <term target-id="massextinction">mass extinctions</term>.  The timing
      of these mass extinctions is shown in <link target-id="table3"/>.

    <para id="para2">
      Each of the first five mass extinctions shown in <link target-id="table3"/> represents a significant loss of biodiversity
      - but recovery has been good on a geologic time scale. Mass
      extinctions are apparently followed by a sudden burst of
      evolutionary diversification on the part of the remaining
      species, presumably because the surviving species started using
      habitats and resources that were previously "occupied" by more
      competitively successful species that went extinct.  However,
      this does not mean that the recoveries from mass extinction have
      been rapid; they have usually required some tens of millions of
      years (<cite target-id="jablonski"><cite-title>Jablonski, 1995</cite-title></cite>).

    <para id="para3">
      It is hypothesized that we are currently on the brink of a
      "sixth mass extinction," but one that differs from previous
      events.  The five other mass extinctions predated humans and
      were probably the ultimate products of some physical process
      (<foreign>e.g.</foreign> climate change through meteor impacts),
      rather than the direct consequence of the action of some other
      species. In contrast, the sixth mass extinction is the product
      of human activity over the last several hundred, or even several
      thousand years. These mass extinctions, and their historic and
      modern consequences are discussed in more detail in the modules
      on <link document="">Historical perspectives on extinction and
      the current biodiversity crisis</link>, and<!-- these cnxns are

      consequences of extinctions.</link>.
